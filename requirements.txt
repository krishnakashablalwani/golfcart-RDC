# Face Capture and Recognition Requirements
# For development on Windows/Mac/Linux and deployment on Raspberry Pi

# OpenCV for computer vision and face detection
opencv-python>=4.8.0

# MongoDB driver for database operations
pymongo>=4.6.0

# NumPy for array operations (required by OpenCV)
numpy>=1.24.0

# Pandas for data manipulation (Excel reading)
pandas>=2.0.0
openpyxl>=3.1.0

# Barcode scanning
pyzbar>=0.1.9

# Optional: Pillow for additional image processing
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Advanced face recognition using deep learning (dlib-based)
# This provides much better accuracy than histogram-based methods
face-recognition>=1.3.0
dlib>=19.24.0

# NOTE: Installing dlib and face_recognition on Windows:
# pip install cmake
# pip install dlib
# pip install face-recognition
#
# If dlib installation fails on Windows, download prebuilt wheel from:
# https://github.com/sachadee/Dlib/tree/main/dlib-19.24.1-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
# Then: pip install <path-to-wheel>

# NOTE: picamera2 is Raspberry Pi specific and must be installed separately on Pi:
# On Raspberry Pi, run:
#   sudo apt-get install python3-picamera2
# 
# picamera2 won't install on Windows/Mac and should be installed via apt on Pi
